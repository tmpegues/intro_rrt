# Intro RRT
Author: Miguel Pegues

This python package implements an RRT algorithm. It was originally made for the python intro for Northwestern University's Master's of Science in Robotic's program ([details](https://nu-msr.github.io/hackathon/rrt_challenge.html)).

I have written this to work for a domain of any number of dimensions, but the tree plotter only works for 2 and 3 dimensions. Please see [`rrt.py`](rrt.py) to see how to use it.
